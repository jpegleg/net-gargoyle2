# net-gargoyle2

Track IP addresses and connection state changes along with running processes.

A basic HIDS component and/or honeypot that stores data in the working directory of the exeution to gargoyle.db, an sqlite3 database file.

The intent is to be a minimal set of functions and structures for a transactional-at-change local blockchain, bassed on active network connections and running processes, and hashes of those outputs.
